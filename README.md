# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) from Scratch 🚀

This repository provides a step-by-step implementation of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) without using any built-in SVD functions.
Instead, I derive 𝙐, Σ, 𝙑ᴴ through eigendecomposition, demonstrating the mathematical foundation behind SVD.

🔹 Features

✔ Computes SVD for a 3×3 matrix from scratch.

✔ Uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors instead of direct SVD calls.

✔ Provides detailed comments & docstrings for clarity.

✔ Helps understand the inner workings of SVD for machine learning & data science.

🔹 How to Run

Simply execute the notebook from top to bottom, it will compute 𝙐, Σ, and 𝙑ᴴ, and verify the decomposition.
